Loops in C++ are essential programming constructs used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specific condition holds true. There are three primary types of loops in C++: the for loop, the while loop, and the do-while loop. Each loop type has its own unique use cases and syntax.
The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known in advance and consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and update. It is commonly employed for tasks like iterating through arrays.
The while loop is employed when you want to execute code as long as a certain condition remains true. It checks the condition before each iteration and is useful when you don't know in advance how many iterations are required.The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees at least one execution of the code block because it checks the condition after the code has run. It's suitable for scenarios where you need to ensure a task is performed at least once.In all three types of loops, you can use the break statement to exit the loop prematurely and the continue statement to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next. Loops are fundamental in automating repetitive tasks and traversing data structures in C++ programs.
